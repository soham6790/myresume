        <h3>A bit about myself</h3>
        <section id="intro">
            <h4>Learner. Problem Solver. Technophile</h4>
            <p>
                Being a hard as well as a smart worker with a positive attitude, I aspire to prove my skills in the fast-moving and dynamic
                world of IT. My goal is to work in a challenging and continuous learning environment where I can enrich myself
                both personally and professionally keeping in practice the quality standards of the organization.
            </p>
            <p>
                I have about 10 years of experience working in the field of IT, mainly in the quality assurance area. Over the years I have
                worked in multiple test automation frameworks across multiple domain and technologies for both windows and
                web applications. I have a passion for learning new tools and technologies in the world of test automation
                which is very dynamic just like technology itselff. Last few years I have been working mostly in web application
                test automation. I have worked extensively on testing various order management systems in the e-commerce
                sector in both frontend and backend space. Working with web applications for so many years has got me fascinated
                towards the design and development of web-based applications, hence nowadays I am investing more time in
                learning about web development
            </p>
            <p>
                When I am not working you can find me playing soccer, hiking, or cooking. Another hobby of mine is visiting different places
                of interest with my wife. We have visited different places in and around the New England area over the last
                few years. We took a trip to the south west last year and was blown away by its rugged beauty. I still can't
                forget the feeling of seeing the grand canyon for the first time. Check out some of the pictures from my
                trip in my gallery section. I enjoy cooking in spare my spare time. Recently I have started learning to play
                the ukulele.
